Prof,

This program implements parallel merge sorting for both alphabetical sorting
and sorting by occurance.

When sorting by count words with the same number of occurances are sorted reverse
alphabetically, though this was more of a happy coincidence with how things wound
up being implemented than anything particularly intentional.
